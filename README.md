## My process

After reading the style guide and creating the React app, I spent the majority of the time making sure all the functional elements worked before starting any styling.  For this project, at least 80% of the logic is driven by the maintenance of the 'filters' used to select the jobs to display.  After that, I started styling the components which lead to a couple iterations of code revisions to add omissions and fix bugs.  And once I thought the code was working as intended, I spent some time refactoring the code, removing console logs, and adding comments.
